## 🎯 Current Projects

### 🎨 ColorThemeGenerator
Extracts dominant colors from JPG or PNG files right in the browser—no server, no tracking.  A Web Worker resizes your image and applies a Voronoi-style “crystallization” filter to generate Light & Dark UI themes with custom shade levels.  Includes contrast-aware sampling, full JSON & TypeScript theme output, and a polished Vuetify 3 frontend. Everything happens client-side for maximum privacy.
